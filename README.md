# Coding Dojo 
This project gives a tutorial for a Coding Dojo.
- A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge.
- Engage in Deliberate Practice: seek out experiences that will stretch your skills just the right amount, and give you feedback that enables you to learn
- "No master ever stops learning"
- Have fun!

## The Rules
- It is a design training place: "the code is the design"
	- Code without tests simply doesn't exist
- Explain what you do and share what you learned
- Slow down. If you know how to do it: Teach! don't be bored

## How?
- Two people at the keyboard solving the Kata together, one driving the keyboard, the co-pilot instructing the driver
- Start from scratch
- Use TDD and Babysteps
- Everyone follows what is going on and can make helpful suggestions
- The pair at the keyboard explains what they are doing
