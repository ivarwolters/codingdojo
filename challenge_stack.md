# The Challenge: A Stack

Implement your own stack (existing .Net implementations are not allowed (list, array, â€¦)

The stack should have the following methods:
- IsEmpty(): Returns an indicator if the stack is empty.
- Push(object): Adds an element to the stack.
- Pop(): Returns the last element and removes it from the stack. (Also take into account that the stack can be empty)
- Peek(): Returns the last element without removing it.
